Hi, I’m Amey, a CS student from India. I like building stuff, exploring tech, and learning by doing. I’ve worked on a range of projects, from compilers to web apps. Outside code, I’m into chess, finance, and philosophy.

## Projects

- [Quark](https://github.com/tervicke/quarkCompiler) – A statically typed programming language targeting the JVM.
- [Tolstoy](https://github.com/tervicke/tolstoy) – A pub-sub messaging system built with Golang.
- [CET College Search](https://github.com/tervicke/CET_college_search) – A web app to filter CET colleges by district, course, and seat type.
